# Marvel Comics

In order to build this app you must register for an API key with develop.marvel.com.

Once you have the public and private API keys then you need to do the following.


Create a file called **apikey.properties** in the root folder of the project.
The body should look like this.

```
MARVEL_API_KEY="[Your public key provided by developer.marvel.com]"
MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY="[Your private key provided by developer.marvel.com]"
```
